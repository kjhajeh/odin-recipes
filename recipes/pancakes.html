        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>Literally a stack of pancakes. Oh it's got some butter on top and it's been drizzled in maple syrup.</em></p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A box of Pancake Mix from the local Wal-Mart or wherever it doesn't matter</li>
            <li>Water (like a cup of it I guess)</li>
            <li>butter (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>maple syrup</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heated skillet, melt the butter.</li>
            <li>While that's going, in a mixing bowl, transfer one package of pancake mix (about 8 cups I think) and mix in 1 cup of water</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly. You should have a very thick mixture.</li>
            <li>From the pancake batter, take one cup and pour it into the heated buttered pan.</li>
            <li>Monitor the pancake. You'll know to flip it once you see some holes appear on top.</li>
            <li>Flip until both sides are cooked evenly</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps until you run out of batter!</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>At this point, you should have about 8 pancakes. Take however many you'd like to eat and<br>stack them! The next steps are purely optional, but recommended for the ultimate<br>pancake experience!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>add a pad of butter on the top of the pancake stack.</li>
            <li>drizze the stack with maple syrup!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And there you have it! Pancakes!</p>
